Some steps for installing Golang in Ubuntu

After you:

```console
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gophers/archive
sudo apt-update
sudo apt-get install golang-1.9-go
```

then you can add this to your ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc

```console
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/go-1.9/bin
```

Assuming that you had port 11371 open which can easily be forgotten with automatic strong firewalls.

Remember to reload your shell by opening and closing or by running
source ~/.zshrc
